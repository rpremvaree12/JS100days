# 100 Days Of JS Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: set up environment, installed node, created template files for the projects, created a simple counter app using event delegation.

**Thoughts:** I learned about the difference between querySelector vs. getELementById and getElementbyClass. Query selector returns the first matching item whereas getElementBy returns a collection of matching items. I also played around a lot with setting up twitter, publishing projects with GH pages. Zino suggested making a screencast. I'll think about how I want to incorporate that into my workflow for my next projects.

### Day 2: February 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: worked on the Day 3 random color generator and finished it. Started the Day 4 Modal Project.

**Thoughts:** Nothing terribly new. It was nice to feel more comfortable with selecting and manipulating DOM elements as well as syntax.

### Day 3: February 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed the modal popup generator for Day 4 projects. Started  markup for the Day 5 project - palindrome checker.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to create a popup using two simple JS functions and display block, display none. I'm not loving the markup part of creating projects but I know it's a necessary part of learning CS.

### Day 4: February 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: finished the palindrome checker rather quickyl due to having a palidrome checker function already completed from FCCs.

**Thoughts:** I was able to reuse an old function that cleaned up the phrase using regex and check for a palindrome. Nothing too fancy with JS but it was good to see how ES6 uses string interpolation similar to Ruby. I showed this project off and the only feedback I got was "why would you want a palindrome checker...?"

### Day 5: February 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished vowel checker using regex and finding the length of the returned list after using match.

**Thoughts:** I could have used a for loop to go through the word but I see regex working in the same way.

### Day 6: March 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the clipboard clicker.

**Thoughts:** Felt very sick and extremely tired yesterday so I didn't get a chance to work on code. I'm okay with that. Not going to be too hard on myself. I learned how to access the clipboard and automatically copy text which was cool to see. I feel more comfortable with understanding then() and arrow functions.
